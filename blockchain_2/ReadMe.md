# Blockchain wallets
In this assignment I created a blockchain transaction that reserved a tutoring
session with a tutor using the Gnache network(Ethereum simulator). I used a variety of libraries
 from the Web3 module which allowed interaction with the blockchain as well as streamlit for user interface. The Wallet library was utilized to create a function that can generate an ethereum account
 which I then used to conduct transactions. Included in this repo are two pictures one of the balance in
 my mock ethereum account and another which is the transaction hash.
