# Blockchain Solution
This repository contains a streamlit web application of a blockchain based
ledger-system. The application leverages the hashlib library
in order to build a blockchain solution that can store all of the 
data(sender,receiver and amount) of a single transaction which makes
 a block in this particular application.  


 Also included in the repository is a photo of a test run of the application
 and a validation check to confirm that the blockchain is in fact valid.
